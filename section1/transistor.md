#### Section 1: Intro: Cheating our way past the transistor -- 0.5 weeks
- So about those transistors -- Course overview. Describe how FPGAs are buildable using transistors, and that ICs are just collections of transistors in a nice reliable package. Understand the LUTs and stuff. Talk briefly about the theory of transistors, but all projects must build on each other so we canâ€™t build one.
- Emulation -- Building on real hardware limits the reach of this course. Using something like Verilator will allow anyone with a computer to play.

#### bipolar transistor
- Transistor is device used for switching or amplification of electric signal.
- 3 terminals(Base, Emitter, Collector)
- conduction between Emitter and Collector depends on the availability of charge carriers, whitch is controlled by a voltage applied to the Base
